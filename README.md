# Arachne: Search Based Repair of Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains artefacts that accompany the paper titled [Search Based Repair of Deep Neural Networks (arXiv preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12463). It contains both the implementation and experimentation of Apricot, a baseline used in the paper, as well as Arachne itself. Please see under the folder `arachne` for the repair tool itself.
